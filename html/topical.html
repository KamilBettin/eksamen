        <p>The success the Scandinavian countries have had balancing a high standard of living with relative equality has attracted the attention of scholars and policymakers the world over. Read on to learn more about what makes the Norwegian model of welfare distinctive—and the role our university plays in sustaining and improving the welfare state.</p>
        <p>Norway ranks near the top of a lot of lists: human development, worker productivity, gender equality, quality of life, peace, happiness—to name just a few. A century ago, this country in the north of Europe was a relatively poor backwater with a rural population and one of Europe's highest rates of emigration. Today, Norway is a forward-thinking, prosperous, increasingly urbanised country of 5.3 million people. </p>
        <p>In the late 1960s, oil and gas reserves were discovered off the western coast of Norway. In a decision that has had far-reaching consequences for Norwegian society, the government established the Government Pension Fund to set aside profits from the sale of oil and gas for future generations. In this way, Norway succeeded in distributing the benefits from its natural resources among its citizens.</p>
