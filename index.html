                <h1>Campus Pilestredet</h1>
                <h2>OsloMets largest campus is located in the centre of Oslo.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="maininfo">
                <p>A number of the buildings are located in the traditional Frydenlund area near Bislett. Where one could previously smell the aroma of malt and hops from one of the largest beer breweries in the country, you will now find teaching rooms, university libraries, reading rooms and canteens.</p>
                <p>Nearby you will find several of the university's buildings in Pilestredet Park, the former Rikshospitalet, and the university's largest building: Ellen Gleditsch's house at Pilestredet 35.</p>
                <p>OsloMet's buildings in Pilestredet have exercise rooms, a climbing wall and gymnasiums that students and teachers can use, also in their spare time. We also have a welfare room for students with, among other things, a tavern.</p>
                <p>In Pilestredet, we have a student square and information center at the faculty for our students. Our main reception is in Clara Holst's house at Pilestredet 46.</p>
